# Oil and Gas Price Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Oil and Gas Price Prediction project! In this project, we utilize various forecasting models to predict the prices of oil and gas products. The goal is to apply different time series analysis techniques to forecast future prices and understand pricing trends. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Oil Ministry of Italy. It includes historical price data for oil and gas products, which is essential for our forecasting models.

## Objectives

- **Linear Models**: Develop and apply linear regression models to predict oil and gas prices based on historical data.
  
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Utilize exponential smoothing techniques to forecast future prices, capturing trends and seasonality.

- **ARIMA Models**: Apply ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for advanced time series forecasting, addressing autocorrelation and trend components in the data.

## Key Features

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyze historical price data to identify trends and patterns.
  
- **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of linear regression, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA models in predicting future prices.

- **Forecasting**: Generate and visualize price forecasts to support decision-making and strategy planning.
