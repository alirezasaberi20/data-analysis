# Statistical Learning Project: Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to the Statistical Learning project! In this R-based project, we use a dataset containing information about used cars to demonstrate price prediction using linear regression, multiple linear regression and polynomial linear regression. This project aims to illustrate how statistical learning techniques can be applied to real-world data for predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes details about used cars, with the following columns:

- **name**: The model name of the car.
- **year**: The year the car was manufactured.
- **selling_price**: The price at which the car is being sold.
- **km_driven**: The total distance the car has been driven (in kilometers).
- **fuel**: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel).
- **seller_type**: The type of seller (e.g., individual, dealer).
- **transmission**: The transmission type (e.g., manual, automatic).
- **Owner**: The number of previous owners of the car.

## Objectives

- **Price Prediction**: Utilize linear regression, multiple linear regression and polynomial linear regression to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (selling price).
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the  models and refine it as needed.
